# Quest "Java 06: Object Oriented Programming"

## Educational exercise from Wild Code School

### Goal

The purpose of this exercice is to create and handle several Java classes, understand what constructors, getters and setter are and create instance methods.

Two classes are given as examples: <code>Duck</code> and <code>Pond</code>. Following those example, the target is to create a <code>Wilder</code> class and a
<code>Classroom</code> class. In the <code>Wilder</code> one, an instance method must be created to define if a Wilder is aware or not. In the 
<code>Classroom</code> class, three instances of the <code>Wilder</code> object must be created and the instance method is called to check if those instances are
aware or not.
